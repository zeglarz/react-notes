# Rememberify App

This is a simple React note taking app that lets you perform basic tasks such as:
 * creating new note or editing by double clicking existing one
 * moving notes accross the viewport
 * remove notes
 * choose between light and dark theme with custom switch

Btw. Do you know why programmers prefer dark mode? 
...
Because it attracts less bugs :)
